   <div class="word"> 
	<p>I'm through with standing in line
	To clubs we'll never get in
	It's like the bottom of the ninth
	And I'm never going to win
	This life hasn't turned out
	Quite the way I want it to be
	</p><br>

	<p>(Tell me what you want)
	</p><br>

	<p>I want a brand new house
	On an episode of Cribs
	And a bathroom
	I can play baseball in
	And a king size tub
	Big enough for ten plus me
	</p><br>

	<p>(So tell me what you need)
	</p><br>

	<p>I'll need a credit card
	That's got no limit
	And a big black jet
	With a bedroom in it
	Going to join the Mile High Club
	At thirty-seven thousand feet
	</p><br>

	<p>(Been there, done that)
	</p><br>

	<p>I want a new tour bus
	Full of old guitars
	My own star
	On Hollywood Boulevard
	Somewhere between Cher and James Dean
	Is fine for me
	</p><br>

	<p>(So how you going to do it?)
	</p><br>

	<p>I'm going to trade this life
	For fortune and fame
	I'd even cut my hair
	And change my name
	</p><br>

	<p>'Cause we all just wanna be
	Big rock-stars
	And live in hilltop houses
	Driving fifteen cars
	</p><br>

	<p>The girls come easy
	And the drugs come cheap
	We'll all stay skinny
	'Cause we just won't eat
	</p><br>

	<p>And we'll, hang out
	In the coolest bars
	In the V.I.P.
	With the movie stars
	</p><br>

	<p>Every good gold digger's
	Going to wind up there
	Every Playboy bunny
	With her bleach blond hair
	</p><br>

	<p>And well
	Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
	Hey, hey, I wanna be a rockstar
	</p><br>

	<p>I wanna be great like Elvis
	Without the tassels
	Hire eight body guards
	That love to beat up assholes
	Sign a couple autographs
	So I can eat my meals for free
	</p><br>

	<p>(I'll have the quesadilla, ah ha)
	</p><br>

	<p>I'm going to dress my ass
	With the latest fashion
	Get a front door key
	To the Playboy mansion
	Going to date a centerfold
	That loves to blow my money for me
	</p><br>

	<p>(So how you gonna do it?)
	</p><br>

	<p>I'm going to trade this life
	For fortune and fame
	I'd even cut my hair
	And change my name
	</p><br>

	Every Playboy bunny
	With her bleach blond hair
	</p><br>

	<p>And we'll, hide out
	In the private rooms
	With the latest dictionary
	And today's Who's Who
	</p><br>

	<p>They'll get you anything
	With that evil smile
	Everybody's got a drug dealer
	On speed dial
	</p><br>

	<p>Well
	Hey hey, I wanna be a rockstar
	</p><br>

	<p>I'm going to sing those songs
	That offend the censors
	Going to pop my pills
	From a Pez dispenser
	</p><br>

	<p>I'll get washed-up singers
	Writing all my songs
	Lip sync them every night
	So I don't get them wrong
	</p><br>

	<p>Well we all just wanna be
	Big rock-stars
	And live in hilltop houses
	Driving fifteen cars
	</p><br>
