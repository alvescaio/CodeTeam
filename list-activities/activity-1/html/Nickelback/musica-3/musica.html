	<p>My best friend gave me the best advice
	He said each day's a gift and not a given right
	Leave no stone unturned
	Leave your fears behind
	And try to take the path less travelled by
	That first step you take is the longest stride
	</p><br>

	<p>If today was your last day
	And tomorrow was too late
	Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
	Would you live each moment like your last?
	Leave old pictures in the past?
	Donate every dime you had?
	If today was your last day
	</p><br>

	<p>Against the grain should be a way of life
	What's worth the price is always worth the fight
	Every second counts 'cause
	There's no second try
	So live like you're never livin twice
	Don't take the free ride in your own life
	</p><br>

	<p>If today was your last day
	And tomorrow was too late
	Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
	Would you live each moment like your last?
	Leave old pictures in the past?
	Donate every dime you had?
	Would you call those friends you never see?
	Reminisce old memories?
	Would you forgive your enemies?
	Would you find that one you're dreaming of?
	Swear up and down to God above
	That you'd finally fall in love?
	If today was your last day
	</p><br>
	<p>If today was your last day
	Would you makeyour mark by mending a broken heart?
	You know it's never too late
	To shoot for the stars
	Regardless of who you are
	So do whatever it takes
	'Cause you can't rewind
	A moment in this life
	Let nothing stand in your way
	'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
	</p><br>
