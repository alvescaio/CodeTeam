	<p>I am so high, I can hear heaven
	I am so high, I can hear heaven
	Whoa, but heaven, no, heaven don't hear me
	</p><br>

	<p>And they say
	That a hero could save us
	I'm not gonna stand here and wait
	I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
	Watch as we all fly away
	</p><br>

	<p>Someone told me
	Love would all save us
	But, how can that be
	Look what love gave us
	</p><br>

	<p>A world full of killing
	And blood spilling
	That world never came
	</p><br>

	<p>And they say
	That a hero could save us
	I'm not gonna stand here and wait
	I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
	Watch as we all fly away
	</p><br>

	<p>Now that the world isn't ending
	It's love that I'm sending to you
	It isn't the love of a hero
	And that's why I fear it won't do
	</p><br>

	<p>And they say
	That a hero could save us
	I'm not gonna stand here and wait
	I'll hold on to the wings of the eagles
	Watch as we all fly away
	<p><br>
	<p>And they're watching us
	They're watching us
	As we all fly away
	<p><br>

	<p>And they're watching us
	They're watching us
	As we all fly away
	<p><br>

	<p>And they're watching us
	They're watching us
	As we all fly away
