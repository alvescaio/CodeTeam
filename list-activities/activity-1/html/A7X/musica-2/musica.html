	<p>Before the story begins, is it such a sin?
	For me to take what's mine until the end of time?
	We were more than friends before the story ends
	And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design
	</p><br>

	<p>Our love had been so strong for far too long
	I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
	Before the possibilities came true
	I took all possibility from you
	</p><br>

	<p>Almost laughed myself to tears
	(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha)
	Conjuring her deepest fears
	(Come here, you fucking bitch)
	</p><br>

	<p>Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
	I can't believe it
	Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
	Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
	</p><br>

	<p>She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
	Now, she's just so perfect, I've never been quite so fucking deep in
	</p><br>

	<p>It goes on, and on, and on
	I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
	With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever
	</p><br>

	<p>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
	Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs
	And I know, I know it's not your time
	But bye, bye
	And a word to the wise when the fire dies
	You think it's over, but it's just begun
	Baby, don't cry
	</p><br>

	<p>You had my heart, at least for the most part
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
	We fell apart, let's make a new start
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
	But, baby, don't cry
	</p><br>

	<p>Now, possibilities I'd never considered
	Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
	Now, an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
	To repossess a body with which I'd misbehaved
	</p><br>

	<p>Smiling right from ear to ear
	Almost laughed herself to tears
	</p><br>

	<p>Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
	I can't believe it
	Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
	Eyes over easy, eat it, eat it, eat it
	</p><br>

	<p>Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
	I must venture back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave
	</p><br>
	
	<p>I gotta make up for what I've done
	'Cause I was all up in a piece of heaven
	While you burned in hell, no peace forever
	</p><br>

	<p>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
	Would be cold that's why I got a heater for your thighs
	And I know, I know it's not your time
	But bye, bye
	And a word to the wise when the fire dies
	You think it's over, but it's just begun
	But, baby, don't cry
	</p><br>
	
	<p>You had my heart, at least for the most part
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
	We fell apart, let's make a new start
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
	But, baby, don't cry
	</p><br>
	
	<p>I will (what will you do?) suffer for so long
	(Not long enough)
	To make it up to you
	(I pray to God that you do)
	I'll do whatever you want me to do
	(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
	And if (if it's not enough) it's not enough
	(If it's not enough)
	If it's not enough
	(Not enough)
	Try again
	(Try again)
	And again
	(And again)
	Over and over again
	</p><br>
	<p>We're coming back, coming back
	We'll live forever, live forever
	Let's have a wedding, have a wedding
	Let's start the killing, start the killing
	</p><br>

	<p>"Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?"
	"Yes, I do"
	"Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?"
	"I do"
	"I now pronounce you"
	</p><br>

	<p>'Cause I really always knew that my little crime
	Would be cold, that's why I got a heater for your thighs
	And I know, I know it's not your time
	But bye, bye
	And a word to the wise when the fire dies
	You think it's over, but it's just begun
	But, baby, don't cry
	</p><br>

	<p>You had my heart, at least for the most part
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
	We fell apart, let's make a new start
	'Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
