 <p class="title"> So Far Away </p>
  <p class="sub-title"> Avenged Sevenfold </p>	
	<div class="word">
	<p>Never feared for anything
	Never shamed, but never free
	A life to heal the broken heart with all that it could
	</p><br>
	
	</p>Lived a life so endlessly
	Saw beyond what others see
	I tried to heal your broken heart
	With all that I could
	</p><br>

	</p>Will you stay?
	Will you stay away forever?
	</p><br>
	
	<p>How do I live without the ones I love?
	Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
	Place and time always on my mind
	I have so much to say, but you're so far away
	</p><br>
	<p>Plans of what our futures hold
	Foolish lies of growing old
	It seems we're so invincible
	The truth is so cold
	</p><br>
	
	<p>A final song, a last request
	A perfect chapter laid to rest
	Now and then, I try to find a place in my mind
	</p><br>
	
	<p>Where you can stay	
	You can stay awake forever
	</p><br>
	
	<p>How do I live without the ones I love?
	Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
	Place and time always on my mind
	I have so much to say, but you're so far away
	</p><br>
	
	<p>Sleep tight, I'm not afraid (not afaid)
	The ones that we love are here with me
	Lay away a place for me
	'Cause as soon as I'm done, I'll be on my way
	To live eternally
	</p><br>
	
	<p>How do I live without the ones I love?
	Time still turns the pages of the book it's burned
	Place and time always on my mind
	And the light you left remains, but it's so hard to stay
	When I have so much to say, and you're so far away
	</p><br>
	
	<p>I love you
	You were ready
	The pain is strong and urges rise
	But I'll see you
	When it lets me
	Your pain is gone, your hands untied
	</p><br>
	
	<p>So far away
	And I need you to know
	</p><br>
	
	<p>So far away
	And I need you to
	Need you to know
	</p><br>
