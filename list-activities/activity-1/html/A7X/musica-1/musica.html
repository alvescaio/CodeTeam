	<p>Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise.
	Living another day in disguise.
	These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight, on tonight.
	</p><br>

	<p>Ooooo?.
	Stand up and fight.
	</p><br>

	<p>The fighting rages on and on, to challenge me you must be strong.
	I walk your land but don't belong, two million soldiers can't be wrong.
	</p><br>

	<p>It's no fun but I've been here before
	I'm far from home and I'm fighting your war.
	(Not the way I pictured this, I wanted better things)
	Some are scared others killing for fun, I shot a mother right in front of her son.
	(Take this from my consciousness, and please erase my dreams)
	</p><br>

	<p>Fight for honor, fight for your life.
	Pray to God that our side is right.
	Even though we won, I still may lose
	Until I make it home to you
	I see our mothers filled with tears,
	grew up so fast where did those years go?
	Memories wont let you cry
	unless I don't return tonight.
	</p><br>

	<p>So many soldiers on the other side, I take their lives so they can't take mine.
	(Scared to make it out alive now murder's all I know.)
	Nobody tells me all the reasons we're here.
	I have my weapons so there's nothing to fear.
	(Another day, another life, but nothing real to show for)
	</p><br>

	<p>Fight for honor, fight for your life.
	Pray to God that our side is right.
	Even though we won, I still may lose
	Until I make it home to you
	I see our mothers filled with tears,
	grew up so fast where did those years go?
	Memories wont let you cry
	unless I don't return tonight.
	</p><br>
	<p>Staring at the carnage, praying that the sun would never rise.
	Living another day in disguise.
	These feelings can't be right, lend me your courage to stand up and fight.
	</p><br>
	
	<p>Watching the death toll rise wondering how I'm alive.
	Stranger's blood on my hands, I've shot all I can
	There are no silent nights, watching your brothers all die
	To destroy all their plans with no thought of me
	No thought of me, no thought of me
	</p><br>
	<p>Ohhhhh?...
	</p><br>

	<p>Walk the city lonely
	Memories that haunt are passing by
	A murderer walks your street tonight
	Forgive me for my crimes; don't forget that I was so young
	Fought so scared in the name of God and country
	</p><br>
