   	<p>She's got a smile that it seems to me
	Reminds me of childhood memories
	Where everything was as fresh
	As the bright blue sky
	</p><br>

	<p>Now and then when I see her face
	She takes me away to that special place
	And if I stare too long
	I'd probably break down and cry
	</p><br>

	<p>Ohh! Ohh! Sweet child o' mine
	Ohh! Ohh! Sweet love of mine
	</p><br>

	<p>She's got eyes of the bluest skies
	As if they thought of rain
	I hate to look into those eyes
	And see an ounce of pain
 	</p><br>

	<p>Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
	Where as a child I'd hide
	And pray for the thunder and the rain
	To quietly pass me by
	</p><br>

	<p>Ohh! Ohh! Sweet child o' mine
	Ohh! Ohh! Sweet love of mine
	</p><br>

	<p>Ohh! Ohh! Sweet child o' mine
	Ohh! Ohh! Sweet love of mine
	</p><br>

	<p>Ohh! Ohh! Sweet child o' mine
	Ohh! Ohh! Sweet love o' mine
	</p><br>
	
	<p>Where do we go?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go?
	Where do we go?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go? (Sweet child)
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go?
	Where do we go now?
	Where do we go?
	Where do we go now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now?
	Sweet child
	Sweet child o' mine
