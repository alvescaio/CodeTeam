	<p>One, two, one, two, three, four
	</p><br>

	<p>Shed a tear 'cause I'm missin' you
	I'm still alright to smile
	Girl, I think about you every day now
	Was a time when I wasn't sure
	But you set my mind at ease
	There is no doubt you're in my heart now
	</p><br>

	<p>Said, woman, take it slow
	And it'll work itself out fine
	All we need is just a little patience
	Said, sugar, make it slow
	And we'll come together fine
	All we need is just a little patience
	Patience
	</p><br>
	
	<p>I sit here on the stairs
	Cause I'd rather be alone
	If I can't have you right now I'll wait, dear
	Sometimes I get so tense
	But I can't speed up the time
	But you know, love, there's one more thing to consider
	</p><br>

	<p>Said, woman, take it slow
	And things will be just fine
	You and I'll just use a little patience
	Said, sugar, take the time
	'Cause the lights are shinin' bright
	You and I've got what it takes to make it
	</p><br>

	<p>We won't fake it
	Oh, I'll never break it
	Cause I can't take it
	</p><br>

	<p>Little patience, mhh yeah
	Need a little patience, mhh yeah
	Just a little patience, mhh yeah
	Some more patience
	</p><br>

	<p>I've been walkin' the streets at night (yeah)
	Just tryin' to get it right (Need some patience)
	It's hard to see with so many around (yeah)
	You know, I don't like being stuck in the crowd (Could use some patience)
	</p><br>

	</p>And the streets don't change but, baby, the names (yeah)
	I ain't got time for the game (Gotta have some patience)
	'Cause I need you, yeah (yeah)
	Yeah, but I need you (All it takes is patience, yeah)
	</p><br>

	<p>Oh, I need you (Just a little patience)
	Oh, I need you (Is all you need)
	Oh, this time
	</p><br>
